64. Minimum Path Sum
Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
  
Example 2:

Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12

Constraints:

m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 200
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200
  
Solution: Iterative Approach with Memorization - (T:O(m*n), S:O(m*n))
  
class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int r = grid.length;
        int c = grid[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[r][c];
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        for (int i = 1; i < c; i++) {
            dp[0][i] = grid[0][i] + dp[0][i-1];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < r; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = grid[i][0] + dp[i-1][0];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < r; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < c; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[r -1][c - 1];
    }
}
